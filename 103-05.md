Node is great for scaling especially if requests are delayed i.e. DB requests
'Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections. The traditional approach to scaling a Node app is to clone it and have the cloned instances share the workload. Node.js even has a built-in module to help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server.'

Need to hold off any I/O blocking tasks or anything that is long processing as it will halt the single thread.


Best suited to apps that require real-time interaction accross devices such as chat systems or other solutions.
