### Pair programing

While I have done this a bunch there are many things here I haven't done before the bgest that I will intentionally do form here on out and remember is th eactuall roles of it.
I would always try to do both in some way no matter what roll I was playing.

From: https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/
"The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code."

**Need to do this ^^^**

### JQuery

from | javascript and jquery book by jon duckett

"Your web page may use files from several different
locations (e.g., images or CSS files might be loaded
from one CDN, jQuery could be loaded from the
jQuery or Google CDNs, and fonts might be loaded
from another third party).
Usually a browser will collect up to two files at a time
from each different server. However, when a browser
starts to download a JavaScript file, it stops all other
downloads and pauses laying out the page until the
script has finished loading and been processed.
Therefore, if you place the script at the end of the
page before the closing </body> tag, it will not affect
the rendering of the rest of the page."
