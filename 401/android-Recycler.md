# dynamic lists with RecyclerView

RecyclerView is used to show large amount of data with  a single view. It works by recycling items as they are scrolled past and using the freed up space to populate the next items that will be scrolled onto the screen. In order to implement a RecyclerView you need to first define a layout strategy, item behavior and then implement this with a new adapter that extends RecyclerView.
