# OAuth

>The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

This along with Spring boot enables you to quickly and easily setup applications that use third party authentication providers and enable users to grant your application limited access to their information within other applications.
