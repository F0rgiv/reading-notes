# Inheritance & Interfaces

## Inheritance
Inheritance in java is an idea where a class can expand upon another but inheriting the methods and variables that exist within it's parent class. 

## Interface
An interface in the Java programming language is an abstract type that is used to specify a behavior that classes must implement. Think of it like a protocol where there is a previously decided upon idea and standard that is followed.
