## Objects and Class 

### Class 
A class is a blueprint that can be used to create multiple objects all with the same general requirements. 

### Object 
An object is Java stores fields and methods that can be ran on it. these can be created from a class and will then inherit the properties from that class 

## Base systems 
A base system in regards to numbers is a different way of counting. Basse ten is what we are used to but base 16(hex) and 2 (Binary) are often used by computers. In a base system you donâ€™t start over at 10 until you have reached the end of your base. So 10 in base ten is = to 10 but in base 2 would be 3. and in base 16 would be 17.
