# Linked List

A linked list is a collection of nodes with two parts the data and a link to the next node in the list. one big Advantage of this is that you can detach and reattach the link to the next node to easily insert into the middle of a list. similarly you can easily remove and add to the list. Additionally you can have more than one pointer in a node aka point to previous. You could also point multiple nodes at the same next.

Biggest downside is that you can't jump to n obj in the linked list.
