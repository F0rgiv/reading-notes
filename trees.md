# Tree

A tree is a data structure that is non linier like a list but that uses nodes starting at a root then then point to more than one "next" node. This allows for them to solve an incredibly amount of problems that would become more expensive to solve. For example in a binary search tree you could easily find the kth smallest element.

* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes
* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

## K-ary Trees
A K-ary Tree is one where each node has no more than K children off of it.

## Binary tree
A Binary tree is a tree with each node having no more then two children.

## Binary Search tree
A Binary search tree is a tree with contents organized into a specific way that enables faster searches within the tree.
